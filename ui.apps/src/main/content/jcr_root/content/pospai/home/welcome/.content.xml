This struck me as a good name for an application that tried to touch on many aspects of Apache Sling, but does not go in depth into any of them."/>

Using convention over configuration, requests are processed by scripts and servlets, dynamically selected based on the current resource. This fosters meaningful URLs and resource driven request processing, while the modular nature of Sling allows for specialized server instances that include only what is needed."/>
